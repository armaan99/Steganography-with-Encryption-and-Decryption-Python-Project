# Steganography-with-Encryption-and-Decryption-Python-Project
Using this Python project you can hide your encrypted/encoded message in any image which can be decrypted/decoded on the receiver's end.

Description of attached files :
1. Steganography with Encryption and Decryption.ipynb   ->  Jupyter Notebook file that consists of the actual Python program made by me.
2. cat.jpg          ->  This is an image of a cat which I have used to hide my encoded/encrpted message.
3. secret_img.png   ->  Image that is generated from Python code which consists of a hidden message.(Looks similar to the actual image which we have used).
